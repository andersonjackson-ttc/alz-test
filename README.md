It is to replace their current pen, paper and Excel solution with a JavaFX front-end and an Access database.  The project will also migrate the existing data from the Excel spreadsheet to the newly created Access database.

The directory system is as follows:

data -- location of the original spreadsheet as well as the newly created database

java -- location of the java project(s)

python -- location of the python code (in particular, the code to migrate the existing data)
